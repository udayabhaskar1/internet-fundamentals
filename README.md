Networking Case Study - Subnetting

Scenario:

A major Australian data analytics company wants to assess and redesign their network. They are opening new branches in Brisbane and Adelaide, which will require new equipment. They have existing contracts and hardware to maintain fibre optic leased line WAN links between sites.

PART 1 - Network specifications and diagram.
PART 2 - Subnetting the network using VLSM, and assigning IP addresses to the appropriate devices
PART 3 - Researching appropriate devices justifying choices (feasibility, efficiency, etc.) with a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM) and a documented report.      
PART 4 - Security by applying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic.
